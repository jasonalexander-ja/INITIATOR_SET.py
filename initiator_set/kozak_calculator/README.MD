# Kozak Calculator

The purpose of this submodule is to calculate the possible Kozak Contexts of a given mrna strand.

Inputs: 
- mRNA strand
- list of relevant kozak consensuses
- *list of initation codons to start from* (requires map_aic to be fixed)

Outputs:
- Analogue similarity distribution mrna sequence
- Analogue similarity ratio to an mrna sequence
- Digital true or false value backed by a single minimum threshold value (self defined)

> As of # ccff10d, this is currently a feature-complete island, waiting for bugs to be fixed on other submodules.
