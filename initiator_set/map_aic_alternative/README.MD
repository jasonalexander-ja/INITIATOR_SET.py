# map_aic_alternative

> ! This submodule is cannon fodder while original Map AIC is being fixed !
 
 Module for mapping an arbitrary piece of mRNA to a predetermined list of
 weights, stored in a textual format.
 
 Forked from map_aic as some of the methods were not working, and it was
 too hard to deal with indexed codons so I just rewrote the entire submodule.
 Textual format remains consistent with original map aic
 
 *Results are currently islanded off from other submodules and utils class*
 
 Too tired to come up with usage examples, just look in __aic_tests.py
